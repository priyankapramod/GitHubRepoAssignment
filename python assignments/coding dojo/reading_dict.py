# Create a dictionary containing some information
# about yourself. The keys should include name, age, country of birth, favorite language.
#
# Write a function that will print something like the following as it executes:
#
# My name is Anna
# My age is 101
# My country of birth is The United States
# My favorite language is Python
# Copy
# There are two steps to this process, building a dictionary and then gathering
# all the data from it. Write a function that can take in and print out any dictionary keys and values.
#
# Note: The majority of data we will manipulate as web developers will be hashed in a dictionary using
# key-value pairs. Repeat this assignment a few times to really get the hang of unpacking dictionaries, as it's a very common requirement of any web application.
